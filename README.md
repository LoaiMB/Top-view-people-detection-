# Detection Model 
In this project, we used YOLOv4-tiny algorithm to perform top-view people detection with transfer learning (fine tuning). We utilized a pre-trained YOLOv4-tiny model that was trained on COCO dataset for object detection. Transfer learning allowed us to train the model to recognize people in top-view images.
